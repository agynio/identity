# Identity Service

The Identity service registers identity IDs and their corresponding types.

Architecture: [Identity](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/identity.md)

## Nickname Lookup Behavior

`BatchGetNicknames` returns entries only for identities with nicknames; identity IDs without a nickname are omitted from the response.
